Their Configuration Management Database is industry-leading with comprehensive discovery tools, relationship mapping capabilities, and impact analysis features. It's built to handle millions of configuration items without breaking a sweat.\n\nJira's asset management capabilities are improving, but remain more basic. While you can track assets and map dependencies, you'll need additional tools or marketplace apps to match ServiceNow's capabilities.\n\n### Automation and AI implementation\n\nBoth platforms have embraced automation, but ServiceNow's AI capabilities run deeper. Their Now Platform includes predictive intelligence, virtual agents, and performance analytics that can automate complex processes end-to-end. [...] ### Market positioning of Jira Service Management and ServiceNow\n\nIn the ITSM heavyweight championship, ServiceNow and Jira Service Management are both top contenders, but they're fighting in slightly different weight classes.\n\nServiceNow has planted its flag as the enterprise-grade platform for organizations looking to digitize workflows beyond IT. It's comprehensive, powerful, and priced accordingly. Companies with complex, multi-departmental needs often gravitate toward ServiceNow for its breadth of capabilities. [...] Jira Service Management, Atlassian's offering, has leveraged its development pedigree to position itself as the ideal solution for organizations where IT and development teams need to work in lockstep. It's particularly strong for businesses embracing DevOps and offers more attractive pricing for mid-sized organizations.\n\nThe gap between these competitors has narrowed significantly in recent years. ServiceNow has improved its developer-friendly features, while Jira has expanded beyond its IT roots into business service management.\n\n## 3.
